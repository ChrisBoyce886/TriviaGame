# Deep Space Trivia

This game is my Unit 5 homework submission for UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp.  

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive trivia game in which the HTML is dynamically updated using Javascript and the jQuery library.

## How to Play
* Click Start
* Timer will automatically start - you will have 1 minute and 30 seconds to complete the 10 question trivia game
* Choose one answer per question and try to get a score of 100%!
* When the trivia game is completed press 'Submit' to see your results.
* If the timer hits 00:00 before you are done the game will automatically stop and will display your results. 

## Design Notes
* Each correct answer is logged and counts the number of correct answers selected according to specific id tag of each radio button. 
* That number is subtracted from 10 to get the incorrect answers.
* The number of correct answers is divided by 10 and multiplied by 100 to get score percentage. 
* All results are displayed when game is over.
